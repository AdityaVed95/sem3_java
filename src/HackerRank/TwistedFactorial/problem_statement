Problem Statement

The twisted factorial is created using the integers in decreasing order by swapping out the multiply operations for a fixed rotation of operations with multiply *, divide /, add +, and subtract - in this order.

For example twist(10) = 10 * 9 / 8 + 7 - 6 * 5 / 4 + 3 - 2 * 1

The solution of the above is still calculated using usual order of arithmetic. Division and Multiplication take precedence over Addition and Subtraction.

Note: The division used is floor division

Above answer goes like = 10 * 9 / 8 = 90 / 8 = 11
